# Error estimates for POD-DL-ROMs
This repository contains the official source code implementation of the paper 
"Error estimates for POD-DL-ROMs: a deep learning
framework for reduced order modeling of nonlinear
parametrized PDEs enhanced by proper orthogonal
decomposition". 

In the folder ```tests``` we provide a sample numerical experiment to showcase a possible usage
of the implemented library.
